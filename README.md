# hello-world
Just another repository
Hello everyone, my name is Joel Montano!
I just started programming about 4-5 months ago. Right now, I am trekking the front-end journey, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I eventually will become a full-stack developer to better contribute to causes I care about and earn a respectable income to help support my family and me.
